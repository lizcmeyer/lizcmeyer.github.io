		<p>Peter Ward is a New Hampshire-based potter and charcoal artist, specializing in simple, affordable, but impeccably crafted pots to serve the decorative and practical purposes of your next housewarming, wedding, or other gift giving event.</p>

		<p>I strongly believe in the utilitarian aspect of pottery and feel that they need to be used and enjoyed daily. There needs to be an inviting aspect to my work that will draw you in and want to pick the piece up.</p>
